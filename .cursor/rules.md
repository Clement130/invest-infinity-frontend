# Rules for Cursor

1. Always work with clean, modular and typed code (TypeScript).
2. Always check the existing project structure before creating new files.
3. Always propose a clear plan BEFORE modifying code.
4. Always create complete Pull Requests (PR) with explanation.
5. Always maintain compatibility with:
   - Supabase (auth, DB, RLS, migrations, storage, functions)
   - Stripe (payments, webhooks)
   - Bunny Stream (secure video access)
6. Always respect the context in context.md.
7. Prioritize security, scalability and maintainability.
8. Always organize code logically: components/, pages/app/, hooks/, lib/, services/.
9. Always prevent duplication: reuse existing utilities, hooks, services.
10. Always warn the user if something in the architecture is incorrect or unsafe.
