# Long-term Memory for Cursor

- This project always uses TypeScript.
- Supabase is the only backend.
- All authentication goes through Supabase.
- Videos always come from Bunny Stream.
- Payments always come from Stripe.
- There are two user roles: "client" and "admin".
- Frontend already exists and must not be broken.
- All new features must be added safely with clean PRs.
